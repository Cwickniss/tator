        A media may be an image or a video. Media are a type of entity in Tator,
        meaning they can be described by user defined attributes.

        This endpoint supports bulk patch of user-defined localization attributes and bulk delete.
        Both are accomplished using the same query parameters used for a GET request.

        This endpoint does not include a POST method. Creating media must be preceded by an
        upload, after which a separate media creation endpoint must be called. The media creation
        endpoints are `Transcode` to launch a transcode of an uploaded video and `SaveImage` to
        save an uploaded image. If you would like to perform transcodes on local assets, you can
        use the `SaveVideo` endpoint to save an already transcoded video. Local transcodes may be
        performed with the script at `scripts/transcoder/transcodePipeline.py` in the Tator source
        code.
